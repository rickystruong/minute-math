# cs32-final-project

This is my final project for CS 32, in which I plan to have random math problems generated for the user to solve.

The program should generate math problems randomly (most of them will be arithmetic).

Then, it will display the math problem, after which the user will be prompted to answer. If the user input is equal to what the program calculates the answer to be, then the user will get a "point," and another math problem will be generated for the loop to go on. Eventually, after a minute (or maybe after a finite amount of problems are solved), the loop ends, and the "score" (total of all "points") will be displayed.
